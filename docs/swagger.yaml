  /ping:
    get:
      description: |-
        In the realm of code where data flows,
        A whisper travels where the network goes.
        With a simple command, a heartbeat is sent,
        To check the connection, to see where it went.

        "Ping," it calls, like a friendly chime,
        A request for response, a dance through time.
        From client to server, a message takes flight,
        In packets it journeys, through day and through night.

        "Are you there?" it asks, with a digital sigh,
        A promise of data, a link to the sky.
        The echo returns, a confirmation so sweet,
        A symphony of bytes, where two systems meet.

        In the world of APIs, where services blend,
        Ping is the guardian, the reliable friend.
        It measures the distance, the latency's grace,
        A pulse of the network, a test of the space.

        So hereâ€™s to the ping, in its silent decree,
        A bridge in the ether, connecting you and me.
        With each little packet, a story unfolds,
        In the language of tech, where the future beholds.
